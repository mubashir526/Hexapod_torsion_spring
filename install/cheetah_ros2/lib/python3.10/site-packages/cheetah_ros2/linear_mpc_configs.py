    # the gravity is added in Q to let Ax + Bu remain as a linear optimization problem, else there would have been a + gravity at the end. To accommodate gravity, we have set it to 0, i.e. derivative of gravity is 0 and we're not supposed to minimize it or anything, simply let it exist in the optimization
    
    # the control inputs are all very small to ensure that whatever foot forces are being used, they get scaled down so they dont approach infinity, and it also helps to minimize them

    # user commands:
    # the user commands are such that the robot moves forward in x axis, but the sdf has +y as forward & +x as right so the commands are swapped when they are being used
